## How does it work?

In order to use the YouTube API and access your account, an OAuth authentication is required. This is done one time and the received refresh token saved in a file on your server.

The OAuth process also requires a client ID (see `config.php`). Please get your own key by creating a new project on [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).


## Limits

* Only for 1 user.
